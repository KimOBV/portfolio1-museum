        <h1>WALK AMONG THE LARGEST CREATURES TO EVER WANDER THE EARTH</h1>
      </section>
      <section class="p2">
        <p>Dinosaurs are a group of reptiles that first appeared about 245 million years ago. They dominated the planet until an extinction event wiped out a large swath of life on earth about 66 million years ago. But now we know that the Age of Dinosaurs never ended. Instead, a group of dinosaurs gave rise to a new, small airborne form: birds.</p>

          <p>Virtual Reality is an interactive experience that takes place within a computer-generated reality. When using a VR-headset you see 360 degrees around you and it feels as though you are face to face with the dinosaurs.</p>

There is a nearly 200 m2 diorama reconstructing the Jurassic period of Zigong, China. This diorama includes some robotic dinosaurs that move and make sounds. <b>“Science of the Earth”</b> (1F) is focusing on the earth science, including the plate tectonics, rock formation, precious gems and so on. There is a hands-on exhibition room for children called <b>“Dino Lab”</b> (1-2F). Visitors can enjoy several quizzes with dinosaur fossils and touch some specimens including a real limb bone of Tyrannosaurus. Visitors can view the inside of the fossil preparation laboratory through the large window. In the second floor, <b>“History of Life”</b> displays various specimens along with the timeline from the birth of life to the present. Exhibits on this floor show how ancient single-celled organisms evolved into dinosaurs and mammals such as human beings.</p>
